# ATO_Surface_Activity
This is a small program for conducting a monte-carlo simulation to calculate the surface activity of antimony-tin oxide (ATO)

Problem Statement:
Tin dioxide (SnO2) has a rutile-like tetragonal structure (a=b=4.74 and c=3.19, Symmetry group P42/mnm). If we consider only the Sn atoms, they form a compressed BCC structure in the unit cell. There are 10 nearest Sn atoms for each atom: 8 sitting on the lattice apexes (+/-0.5a, +/-0.5b, +/-0.5c), and two sitting in the center of the unit cells above and below (0, 0, +/-1c).
When one Sn atom is replaced by Sb, it supposedly activates itself and the 10 nearest Sn atoms. However, if there are two Sb atoms, both of them become inactive.
Now consider the surface of Sb-replaced SnO2 lattice. Assuming that the surface is composed of one of the 4 strongest diffraction planes: (110), (101), (200) and (211), what are the corresponding fraction of the "active" atoms in each surface plane? Note: only the atoms in or below the surface will activate or de-activate other atoms.
